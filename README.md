# THESEUS & THE MINOTAUR

## Preamble

###### For my Feature, I decided to construct a game based on the Greek legend of Theseus & the Minotaur. I wanted the Minotaur to be at the centre, and a number of Theseus sprites to navigate the Labyrinth and reach the Minotaur, whereupon they slay it. I envisaged that each Theseus would be timed as they made their way through the maze to reach Theseus, and each would be timed. The real objective of the game would be to time each Theseus sprite, and compare them, with a message on screen displaying which Theseus reached the Minotaur in the quickest time. 

## Preparation and Considerations

###### Paul Vickers' book 'How To Think Like A Programmer', which I was introduced to when studying a stand-alone module in Problem-Solving for Programming module at Birkbeck, was helpful in instilling in me a rational, analytical, programming mindset, in which problem solving and planning takes up the majority of the time, with the coding only taking place afterwards. The book gets across helping to solve the problem of what is required first before only committing to the code. 

###### My first step was to think about what were required and write them down:
-	The game container, which contains the game
-	The game map
-	The controls
-	The layers: 
1.	Floor
2.	Walls
-	Sprites:
1.	Theseus * 4
2.	Minotaur
-	Background on screen to the legend of Theseus and Minotaur
-	Score counter
-	Start / Pause button
-	Success message within the game map that appears when Theseus slays the minotaur, displaying the time that has taken for each Theseus to do so
-	Instructions on controlling the Theseus sprite via cursor keys or buttons 
-	Visual controls on the screens
-	Final results that show which Theseus was the quickest to display the Minotaur



Initially I came up with a number of four Theseuses, but time constraints dictated otherwise, and it seemed less important when the
