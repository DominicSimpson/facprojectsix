    <p>In Greek legend, King Minos of Crete waged war against the city of Athens, and the Athenians who lived in the city. 
      He demanded that at nine-year intervals, seven Athenian boys and seven Athenian girls were to be sent to Crete to be 
      devoured by the Minotaur &#9472; a half-man, half-bull monster who dwelled in the Labyrinth, a disorientating maze-like 
      structure. The Labyrinth was created by Daedalus, a skilled architect and craftsman.
      The Minotaur was so wild a beast that it was kept imprisoned in the Labyrinth under guard.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Theseus &#9472; the son of Aegeus, King of Athens &#9472; was horrified at the practice of seeing young Athenians 
      slaughtered so needlessly by the Minotaur at King Minos&#8217; orders. He took it upon himself to take the place of 
      one of the youths and set off to Crete. As with the others, Theseus was stripped of his weapons once on the boat.</p> 
      
      <p>On his arrival, Ariadne, King Minos&#8217; daughter, fell in love with Theseus. 
        On the advice of Daedalus, Ariadne gave Theseus a ball of thread so that he could find his way out of the Labyrinth, 
        and took him to it. 
        As soon as Theseus entered the Labyrinth, he tied one end of the ball of string to the doorpost and brandished his 
        sword which he had kept hidden from the guards inside his tunic. Theseus came to the heart of the Labyrinth, where 
        he found the sleeping Minotaur. The beast awoke and a tremendous fight then occurred. Theseus overpowered the 
        Minotaur and killed the beast with his sword. Using the string, Theseus then found his way out of the Labyrinth 
        and escaped with Ariadne and the young Athenians.

      <p>In this game, there will be two Theseus sprites, one after another. 
        The goal is to reach the Minotaur at the centre of the Labyrinth. Use the cursor keys or onscreen buttons to move each 
        Theseus sprite and navigate the Labyrinth to reach the Minotaur and slay it. 
        A timer will record how quickly each sprite has taken to reach the Minotaur; the winner is the one that has 
        reached the Minotaur the quickest. This will be announced at the end of the game.</p>

      <p>Press the Start button to begin.</p>
